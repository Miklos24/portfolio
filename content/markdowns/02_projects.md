You're looking at it!

This website was built using [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev), a lightweight web
framework for [Deno](https://deno.com). It leverages&nbsp;
[Preact](https://preactjs.com) for rendering UI and Markdown for content, and
contains all the information I might want a curious visitor to know about me.

## hairbypage.com [↗](https://github.com/Miklos24/hair-by-page)

I built [hairbypage.com](https://hairbypage.com) for my partner's hairdressing
business, Hair By Page. It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and&nbsp;
[React](https://reactjs.org), and calls the&nbsp;
[Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/)
&nbsp;and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging) APIs to display her
latest posts and allow clients to book appointments.
