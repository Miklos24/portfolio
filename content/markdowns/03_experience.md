## software engineer @ PayPal

### _(2022 - present)_

I work on [PayPal login](https://paypal.com/login), where I build the front end
with [React](https://reactjs.org) and&nbsp;
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), leveraging&nbsp;
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for server-side rendering. I've also had a hand in
implementing a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) midlayer and ensuring strong unit
and end-to-end test coverage.
